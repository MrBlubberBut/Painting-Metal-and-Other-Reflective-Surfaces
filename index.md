This is the beginning of a (most likely) very long and thorough tutorial about painting metallic and reflective surfaces in general. I will first go over painting metal.

Painting metal, whether you photobash it or hand draw it, is always a complex process. There are a lot of things to it; all of which I will explain here.

The first and most obvious example I will demonstrate is a mirror. A mirror is simply a smooth, naturally reflective metal such as silver behind a piece of glass.

It's very simple; the light rays that hit the mirror bounce off in the opposite angle in which it came from.

Compared to a diffused surface, shown below:

I'm sure all of you have seen diagrams like these before.
