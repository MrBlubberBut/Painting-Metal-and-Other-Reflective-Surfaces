This is the beginning of a (most likely) very long and thorough tutorial about painting metallic and reflective surfaces in general. I will first go over painting metal.

Painting metal, whether you photobash it or hand draw it, is always a complex process. There are a lot of things to it; all of which I will explain here.

The first and most obvious example I will demonstrate is a mirror. A mirror is simply a smooth, naturally reflective metal such as silver behind a piece of glass.

It's very simple; the light rays that hit the mirror bounce off in the opposite angle in which it came from.

Compared to a diffused surface, shown below:

I'm sure all of you have seen diagrams like these before, but I will explain regardless.

The smooth surface in the first image is simple enough. You will see the sun in the center of the mirror, reflecting right back at you.

In the second image, you are going to see the sun everywhere, thus making the object evenly bright throughout. There will, however, most likely be a bit of a bright spot in the center, where the sun would be if it were a mirror; unless the object is a perfectly diffused material, in which case that would not happen (we will get to that later).

I think, for now, everyone is on the same page.

Now things are going to get a bit more fun! Let's draw another mirror as example.

Look at this picture. Where would the ball be, if the cube were a perfect mirror? Feel free to think for a moment.

If this looks about right to you, perfect! That was an easy example though.

Let's get a bit more difficult.

Where would the ball be in this case?
